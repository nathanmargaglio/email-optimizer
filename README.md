# Email HTML Optimizer

A small, stand-alone utility designed specifically to minify HTML files that need to maintain compatibility with various clients (I'm looking at you, Outlook).

You can use the tool at https://nathanmargaglio.github.io/email-optimizer/index.html

It's simple but effective.  Feel free to contribute.
